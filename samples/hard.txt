Fetch me my pills robot boy.

I can't feel my toes.

I feel pain in my chest
.
My poop is green.

My head hurts.

My mouth is dry.

My tounge itches, and I can't breath, Help.

My left arm is tickling.

I am having a seizure.

I feel sad, like more sad than normal.

I am seeing things, I think I am halucinating.

Deary, my nose is bleading.

My hip is making clicking sounds.

I can't see anything, the room is spinning.

I can't breath, can you find the inhailer.
